            The quest to create intelligent machines is as old as civilization itself, from ancient 
            myths of mechanical beings to Leonardo da Vinci's automata designs. But the scientific 
            pursuit of artificial intelligence began in earnest in the mid-20th century, when 
            pioneers dared to ask: "Can machines think?"
